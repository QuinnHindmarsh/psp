#assumptions
"""
all assumptions i have made while creating the project are listed here

the task states rolling 3 1s,3s or 5s means zero damage will be dealt. i have assumed if 4 or 5 1s,0s or 5s are rolled it will also be zero damage
similaraly ill also assume rolling 4/5 2s,4s or 6s will triple the damage like 3 of a kind would

i assume in 1 round both the player and the dragon attack e.g. if there are 5 rounds each attacks 5 times
